Designed and implemented data visualization on a Soccer World cup data, which shows 
the various countries which participated and hosted the world cup between 1930-2014. 
Used JavaScript library d3.js to implement the animated visualization.

Determined the 'attendance' of each world cup by taking advantage of visual encoding 
and pre-attentive processing techniques. The visualization is an author driven 
narrative with an animation encompassing data of all the world cups and is also 
viewer driven, as there are buttons to let user view the analysis of any particular 
world cup year. 

Skills: JavaScript, D3.js, SVG
